The DLS ensures that users have a smooth experience while browsing. One of the key features of this portal is the ability for users to customise and personalise their experience, making it more efficient and user-friendly. A personalised dashboard enables users to access, store, and review their data, interactions and transactions on the portal. Specific service transactions initiated through the portal can be saved and accessed later.
